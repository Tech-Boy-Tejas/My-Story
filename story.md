When we think of a monkey, we think of mischief and trouble. But not of intelligence.

That’s why the phrase ‘clever as a monkey’ is used to refer to someone foolish or unintelligent. But studies say that monkeys are smarter than they seem. In fact, folk tales and fables have had monkeys displaying their intelligence to get out of difficult or tricky situations. One such example is the monkey and the crocodile story.

MomJunction brings the abridged version of this story along with information about the origin of the story and its popularity.

Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a berry tree, on the banks of a river. In the same forest lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile wanders deep into the river and comes to rest under the berry tree, on which the monkey lived.

The crocodile, having swum up quite a distance, was tired and hungry. The kind monkey sees that the crocodile is hungry and shares the berries with the crocodile. The crocodile eats the sweet berries, thanks the monkey, and goes back home.
