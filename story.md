When we think of a monkey, we think of mischief and trouble. But not of intelligence.

That’s why the phrase ‘clever as a monkey’ is used to refer to someone foolish or unintelligent. But studies say that monkeys are smarter than they seem. In fact, folk tales and fables have had monkeys displaying their intelligence to get out of difficult or tricky situations. One such example is the monkey and the crocodile story.
